# CHANGELOG


## Unreleased


### 29 Jan 2025

- ([`763386f`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/763386f)) docs: update changelog
- ([`e92dc22`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/e92dc22)) fix: resolve type warnings in test file

  > Also disables a few more warnings - no need to handle return values in
  > test cases, and exclude_addons for now so we don't see a million gdunit
  > type warnings.
  > 
  > It should be noted that exclude_addons should be toggled while working
  > on log.gd to see the errors in that file.

- ([`b3472b1`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/b3472b1)) feat: satisfy the static type gods

  > Disables the unsafe cast check b/c the logic to deal with it would be
  > crazy in log's main Variant -> String function.
  > 
  > The move to `.call(method-name)` after `.has_method(method-name)` is
  > annoying but w/e that's what the tool is pushing us into. It's the same
  > result, anyway.

- ([`a5fe8b8`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/a5fe8b8)) wip: refactor log/log.gd to use static typing everywhere

  > Not quite zero errors yet - just need to figure out how to safe-cast.


### 12 Oct 2024

- ([`901adb5`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/901adb5)) feat: add Log.todo() for auto-prepending '[TODO]'

### 17 Aug 2024

- ([`444e920`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/444e920)) fix: don't use installed gdunit?
- ([`5ac864a`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/5ac864a)) feat: update to 4.3, include 4.3 in tests
- ([`e4f6479`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/e4f6479)) deps: update gdunit4

### 22 Jun 2024

- ([`fa781a3`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/fa781a3)) deps: update gdunit
- ([`05f9236`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/05f9236)) chore: test on 4.3.beta2

## v0.0.6


### 22 Jun 2024

- ([`91bf5d7`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/91bf5d7)) release: new version: v0.0.6
- ([`486a8c8`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/486a8c8)) todo: drop 0.7.0 todo tag
- ([`c6570b7`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/c6570b7)) docs: add godot-help friendly docstrings
- ([`b000997`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/b000997)) refactor: cleaner theme and type overwrites
- ([`3145b3e`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/3145b3e)) refactor: use consts instead of enum for config theme

  > I thought the enum would give the project settings a simple dropdown,
  > but it doesn't, so no need to take on the enum's problems for nothing.

- ([`da944b3`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/da944b3)) refactor: move to config theme enum

  > To ease project configuration, this moves from a big ole dictionary to
  > an enum for selecting a pre-existing theme. Really I'd like to support
  > custom themes, which won't work with this enum... but that can come
  > later.
  > 
  > Renames 'color_scheme' to 'color_theme'.

- ([`86b791a`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/86b791a)) docs: update changelog
- ([`bde09f1`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/bde09f1)) fix: changelog commit sorting

### 20 Jun 2024

- ([`ff14ee4`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/ff14ee4)) chore: update discord link

### 6 Jun 2024

- ([`e2ba116`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/e2ba116)) docs: update changelog
- ([`af59d90`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/af59d90)) fix: prevent errors at startup, remove noisey logs

  > ProjectSettings-supported config seems to be working as expected!
  > Huzzah!

- ([`0251bdb`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/0251bdb)) refactor: move config from editor- to projectSettings

  > EditorSettings are per-machine and not accessible when starting
  > scenes (even from the editor). So instead we use the projectSettings,
  > to at least get these config vals going.
  > 
  > This might make more sense than editor settings, and could be useful to
  > override with feature tags and what not.
  > 
  > Still a bit of a mess, naming-wise, and seems to throw errors before the
  > settings have been created in the project :/

- ([`2a4f1c2`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/2a4f1c2)) ci: test fewer and updated godot versions
- ([`f231e70`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/f231e70)) deps: update gdunit4, ignore /test dir
- ([`4b137b7`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/4b137b7)) feat: introduce Log.gd editor-settings

  > Hooks into the editor_settings.settings_changed signal - towards
  > supporting setting custom values for Log.gd config options, such as
  > disable_colors and max_array_size. Not _quite_ working, but this is the
  > bulk of the work.

- ([`a1cc3e2`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/a1cc3e2)) fix: use installed gdunit version
- ([`0177263`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/0177263)) wip: vscode launch json, some basic ansi-code attempts
- ([`31ef24c`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/31ef24c)) feat: Log.disable_colors() and Log.enable_colors()

  > Color wrapping can now be globally disabled via Log.disable_colors().
  > This could help in some situations where the colors are not interpreted
  > and the output is an unreadable mess of `[color=blah][/color]` tags.


### 4 Jun 2024

- ([`92b62b0`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/92b62b0)) chore: update github funding links

### 6 May 2024

- ([`80238ba`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/80238ba)) license: add license to addons/log dir

### 13 Apr 2024

- ([`5719e6b`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/5719e6b)) deps: update gdunit
- ([`2bd6de4`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/2bd6de4)) deps: drop gd-plug-ui

  > I'm not using this anyway - dropping while i resolve whatever's up with CI.

- ([`ce88e7d`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/ce88e7d)) chore: drop editor plugin enter/exit

  > No need for this at the moment.

- ([`0ca78cc`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/0ca78cc)) fix: pass already colorized strings through
- ([`792026f`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/792026f)) fix: move SomeResource to @tool script
- ([`62d535f`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/62d535f)) test: more color overwriting coverage

  > A test covering overwriting a specific color via
  > Log.set_color_scheme(scheme)

- ([`f62b9e7`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/f62b9e7)) feat: support color overwriting via Log.to_pretty

  > The color schemes are now built once in Log.to_pretty, and merged into a
  > single map. This lets a minimal amount of colors be overwritten by a
  > passed dictionary, and leaves the rest of the colors as-is.
  > 
  > Passing color overwrites at the log callsite is a pain at the moment -
  > the variadic log functions don't make it clear where an opts dictionary
  > could be passed, and passing the result of Log.pretty to one of the
  > public Log funcs will print it as a string, which is not ideal

- ([`347a527`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/347a527)) ci: bump godot 4.2.2 test version
- ([`6bbac1d`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/6bbac1d)) ci: update gdunit4 action version
- ([`b8e5958`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/b8e5958)) feat: proof of concept for swapping color schemes

  > Inits a Log.config dictionary that pulls the color scheme from
  > config.color_scheme. The colors can also be passed to Log.to_pretty in
  > the opts dict.
  > 
  > Once the schemes are being merged, it'll be possible to overwrite
  > specific types without clearing the rest of the colors.
  > 
  > Ideally the prettier colors would be opt-ed into by the editor-launched
  > games, and the term-safe would be used in other circumstances (test
  > runners, 'built' production games)
  > 
  > A similar feature should make it easy to opt-out of colors - I wonder if
  > it's easy to read a `--log-no-colors` arg from the command line.

- ([`54d8bb2`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/54d8bb2)) todos: some documentation ideas
- ([`30d32f2`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/30d32f2)) docs: update changelog

  > Also auto-commits in `bb changelog`. Ideally this would be optional, but
  > i don't want to mess with the first arg - ought to up my
  > bb-task-cli-opts game a bit.

- ([`4e2241c`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/4e2241c)) feat: Log.register_overwrite(type_or_class, func(x, opts))

  > Adds support for registering a handler for a type or class. The handler
  > is stored on a Log.log_overwrites static var and used to cut off the
  > default log implementation for that type/class.
  > 
  > Easier than i thought to implement! Perhaps we could use a similar
  > structure for log's config data (e.g. max_array_size, color_scheme, etc)

- ([`fc43d65`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/fc43d65)) test: basic custom_resource coverage

  > Not necessarily the behavior we want, but here's what we've got for now.


### 12 Apr 2024

- ([`d06b6bb`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/d06b6bb)) chore: misc bb release improvements
- ([`f583a19`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/f583a19)) chore: new version: v0.0.5
- ([`d13aea0`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/d13aea0)) docs: update changelog
- ([`8abba09`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/8abba09)) fix: don't over indent arrays of dicts

  > the opts dictionary was being updated in place, which was resulting in
  > the third dictionary in an array being indented three times (instead of 1).
  > 
  > Notably the tests don't cover whitespace very well at the moment, but
  > w/e, it's fixed.

- ([`b8de312`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/b8de312)) test: coverage for vectors, null, bool, etc

  > Adds coverage for more types, and stubs test code/todos for more that
  > deserve coverage.

- ([`e3cc213`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/e3cc213)) feat: support to_pretty() and Log.to_pretty()

  > Log.to_pretty(obj) can be used to get a colorized string version of the
  > passed object - this is what is eventually printed via print_rich, but
  > it can be useful for UIs as well (e.g. passed into a RichText Label)
  > 
  > to_pretty() is now a third method that can be implemented on an
  > object/class/custom_resource to specify the logged data when that object
  > is logged.
  > 
  > Also refactors and fixes the tests a bit, in preparation for testing
  > more types.

- ([`38a506d`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/38a506d)) refactor: add Custom Resource to example scene

  > Adds a basic Custom Resource with a to_printable func to show the
  > currently supported case.

- ([`34c4b03`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/34c4b03)) feat: support vector3s and 4s, some color tweaks

### 27 Mar 2024

- ([`e8d7b05`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/e8d7b05)) fix: restore current tests after color changes

  > Ideally these wouldn't be so brittle - maybe swapping in color palettes
  > will help.

- ([`b7241fa`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/b7241fa)) wip: initial PackedScene and RefCounted handling

  > Now printing a short filename for the resource_path behind the logged
  > PackedScene or RefCounted object, if it exists. Could perhaps get wiser
  > about applying this to more types, but for now I'm hitting objects that
  > show up in my own work, and these seemed like a quick win.
  > 
  > Testing to come before the next version release!


### 26 Mar 2024

- ([`bf31411`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/bf31411)) fix: prettier colors, fix test/addons mixup
- ([`35e82c7`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/35e82c7)) refactor: towards swappable color schemes

  > Refactors to_pretty, pulling color-selection completely into the
  > color_wrap function. Adds two basic color schemes, which are really not
  > that different at the moment - these are dictionaries that support a
  > bunch of `typeof` ints and some specific type overwrites for various
  > punctutation, dictionary keys, vector vals, etc.
  > 
  > It's a bit annoying to work with these as static vars b/c the editor
  > keeps their initial state, which hurts the feedback loop if you edit and
  > want to see nice logs without running the whole game. Probably these
  > will need to move to configs or some other place at some point.
  > 
  > Not loving the green or color choices in general yet - i'll have to dig
  > up my original screenshots from last year.
  > 
  > Also, could use some test coverage on this! For now, the colors are
  > still hard-coded (i.e. not swappable).


### 24 Mar 2024

- ([`6449476`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/6449476)) docs: update changelog

- ([`f5623cd`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/f5623cd): Chris Ridenour) Fix API descriptions in README.md

- ([`c0a9e37`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/c0a9e37)) docs: extend changelog to specify a latest version label

  > This lets me write the changelog with the new tag before it actually
  > exists. There's a chicken-and-egg problem with using tags to create the
  > changelog - i want the changelog update included in the tagged commit
  > itself, so we have to fake the tag's existence first.

- ([`a8dd5c3`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/a8dd5c3)) docs: monospace hashes and subject lines

  > also refactors to_pretty to use an opts dictionary instead of continuing
  > to add optional params. This should create some space for more options
  > and clean up the impl going forward.

- ([`1bce1eb`](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd/commit/1bce1eb)) feat: support Object.to_printable() via duck-typing

  > Any object can now opt-in to some other logged form by implementing an
  > arg-less to_printable() function.
  > 
  > I wanted something cute, but `log()` already does logarithms, and pr()
  > or pp() felt obscure for a public function.
